XBRLStudio desktop application

SUMMARY

This project utilizes publicly available XBRL filings to enable efficient research and evaluation of commercial entities, for example, as part of a method for security analysis. Given a quarterly filing in XBRL format, this desktop application is capable of importing it into a database, querying the database for imported filings, and analyzing filings in a table and, if desired, a graph. Facts are divided into numerical and textual representations. The former are able to be plotted, while the latter are viewed with the program's embedded browser. Available under the MIT license.
