# xbrlstudio
XBRLStudio desktop application

SUMMARY

XBRLStudio utilizes Arelle to analyze publicly available XBRL filings to enable efficient research and evaluation of commercial entities, for example, as part of a method for security analysis. Given a quarterly filing in XBRL format, the application is capable of importing it into a database, querying the database for imported filings, and analyzing filings in a table and, if desired, a visual graph (bar, line, or dotted). Facts are divided into numerical and textual representations. The former are able to be plotted, while the latter are viewable with the program's embedded browser. Available under the MIT license.
